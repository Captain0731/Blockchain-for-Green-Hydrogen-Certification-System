📌 Full Project Prompt

Title: Blockchain-based Green Hydrogen Certification & Credit Tracking System (with 3D Visualization)

🔧 Tech Stack

Backend: Python (Flask)

Database: SQLite (for testing; can migrate to PostgreSQL/MySQL)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind or Bootstrap, Dark/Light theme support

3D Visualization: Three.js (WebGL) for 3D dashboard & blockchain explorer

Blockchain: Simulated blockchain ledger in Python (basic proof-of-work and hashing for demo)

🌍 Core Features
1. Authentication

Login / Signup system using Flask-Login

Secure password hashing (Werkzeug)

Session-based authentication

2. Pages

Home Page → Overview of green hydrogen certification

Login / Signup Page → User account creation & login forms

Dashboard Page →

User profile

Issued certificates overview

Credit balances & transfers

Blockchain explorer (3D view)

3. Dashboard Sections

Profile Section: User details, total credits, account info

Certificates Section: Issue, view, and verify hydrogen certificates

Credits Section: Add, transfer, or redeem hydrogen credits

Blockchain Explorer: Interactive 3D chain of blocks with block details (index, timestamp, hash, transactions)

4. Blockchain Simulation

Each transaction (certificate issuance, credit transfer) is recorded in a block

Simple proof-of-work mining for demo purposes

Blocks chained with hashes & displayed in a 3D blockchain explorer

🎨 Design Requirements

Theme:

Dark & Light theme toggle

Dark Mode → Background #0f1724, text #e6eef6

Light Mode → Background #ffffff, text #0b1220

Accent Colors → Light Green (#32CD32), Blue (#1E90FF)

Layout:

Sidebar navigation (Home, Certificates, Credits, Blockchain, Profile)

Navbar with theme toggle

Dashboard cards & widgets for certificates, credits, and blockchain status

Responsive grid-based design

🗄 Database (SQLite for testing)

users → id, username, email, password_hash, created_at

certificates → id, user_id, certificate_id, issue_date, status, meta_json

credits → id, user_id, amount, transaction_type, date, meta_json

blocks → id, index, previous_hash, timestamp, transactions_json, nonce, hash

🌐 Routes (Flask)

/ → Home (overview)

/signup → Register a new user

/login → Login page

/logout → Logout user

/dashboard → Main dashboard

/certificates → Manage & issue hydrogen certificates

/transfer_credits → Transfer credits to other users

/blockchain → 3D blockchain explorer page

/api/blocks → JSON endpoint with blockchain data

/api/transactions → JSON endpoint with transactions

🖼 UI Components

Sidebar Navigation → Icons for navigation (Certificates, Credits, Blockchain, Profile)

Navbar → App title, theme toggle, profile menu

Dashboard Cards →

Credits balance (3D coin stack animation)

Certificates (3D card visualization)

Blockchain health status

Tables & Lists → Certificates, credit transactions

3D Blockchain Explorer →

Blocks as 3D cubes linked in space

Clickable to show details (timestamp, transactions, hash)

Orbit controls to rotate & zoom

Animations →

Blocks glow while mining

Coin/credit transfer animation between users

Certificates flip like 3D cards

🚀 Deliverables

Flask project structure with routes, templates, and static assets

SQLite database for quick testing

Authentication system with secure password storage

Blockchain simulator with block + transaction handling

Dark/Light responsive UI

3D dashboard widgets + blockchain explorer (Three.js integration)
